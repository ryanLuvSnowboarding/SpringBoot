# This is web application for users to make online orders similar to UberEats / DoorDash. 

In the backend, I implement user signup, login, logout, get all restaurants menus and single restaurant's menus, 
add food to the cart, modify the cart and checkout the cart functionalities.

## The SignUp page: user can register and login to our home page
